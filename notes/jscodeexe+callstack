JS EXECUTION CONTEXT 
Global execution context
==this

two phases ==memory allocation
           ==excecution phases
           
           //not that much but 
           ==Eval execution context

js is single threaded language
works on stack memory ie LIFO
if we call function in in another function , those function will be treated in stack memory

=first program will be allocated in global execution context ie allocated in this 
=then it will go through memory allocation
=then in execution phase and in exe phase there may be another thread , and in that thread there will be
  another exe and memory alloc phase and when its work will be over it will be deleted
